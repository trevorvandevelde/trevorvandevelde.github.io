                        The idea is that it provides a much more efficient,
                        streamlined way of viewing different pages if you know
                        how to use it, and it also provides a different
                        perspective on going through content than the normal
                        linear style.

                        busy with worrying about finals, relaxing for a couple
                        days, and back to worrying again as my flight to
                        Edinburgh is in two days. I've made all my checklists -
                        going to spend the next two days packing, saying my
                        final goodbyes, and selecting books/movies to peruse for
                        the 17-hour journey. I'm so excited! Also side note,
                        I've shifted most of my journaling to Agenda, so I might
                        report here less frequently. I'll find time eventually
                        to update all my projects and experience and such,
                        though.

                        <b>12/05/2019.</b> Thanksgiving break was great! Finally
                        played Scythe with my family, which was something I had
                        been looking forward to do for a while. Pretty much
                        counting down the days till I'm going abroad at this
                        point -- I'm very excited. Just waiting to get through
                        this semester, finals and all, and have a fun-packed
                        (very short) winter break!

                        <b>11/23/2019</b>. Fun fact - my computer needed repairs
                        so I turned it over to the Apple Store. I thought I had
                        backed up everything on my computer, but for this
                        website, turns out I only had access to the minified,
                        production code, which is obviously very different than
                        code that I could actually edit. <br />
                        And of course, my computer got wiped, so I lost all the
                        code for this website :( That's why I haven't updated it
                        for a while, but I found time today to go through and
                        reimplement all the code and content, and backed
                        everything to multiple places, so everything should be
                        good now. I'll make sure to go back to the regular,
                        weekly updates going forward!

                        <b>10/13/2019</b>. Power was out for three days so we
                        had a five-day weekend; naturally, I was about 10x less
                        productive than I should've been. So much stuff to do
                        this week; I hope I can do all of it justice.

                        <b>10/07/19</b>. I'm going to try to post weekly updates
                        here every week! This is basically a blog but a bit more
                        manageable and in a form that I'm comfortable with.
                        Eventually I want to link this with my texting journal
                        app so I can make texts to this page directly.
